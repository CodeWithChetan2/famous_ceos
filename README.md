**Project Structure:**

1. **Dataset Folder:**
   - This folder contains your raw dataset and any preprocessed data. It might be organized as follows:
     - `raw_images/`: Original images
     - `cropped_images/`: Images after preprocessing

2. **Code Files:**
   - `pca_project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing your code for image classification using VGG16 and any data analysis.
   - `server/`: This folder contains your Flask server and related files.
     - `server.py`: Flask server script.
     - `util.py`: Utility functions used by the server.
     - `wavelet.py`: Functions for wavelet transformation (if used).
   - `webscraping_images/`: Folder for web scraping scripts.
     - `img2.py`: Python script using BeautifulSoup for web scraping.
     - `img.py`: Python script using Selenium for web scraping.

3. **User Interface (UI):**
   - `UI/`: This folder contains your web interface files.
     - `index.html`: HTML file for the user interface.
     - `style.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
     - `script.js`: JavaScript file for handling UI interactions.

**Workflow:**

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Use `img2.py` and `img.py` to scrape images from the web and save them in the `raw_images/` folder.
   - Perform any necessary data cleaning and preprocessing, saving the processed images in the `cropped_images/` folder.

2. **Data Analysis and Model Building:**
   - Use `pca_project.ipynb` to analyze the dataset, perform image classification using VGG16 (utilizing transfer learning), and evaluate the model's performance.
   - Save the trained model and any relevant data for later use.

3. **Flask Server:**
   - Set up your Flask server using `server.py`.
   - Define routes and endpoints for interacting with the model.
   - Utilize functions from `util.py` and `wavelet.py` as needed.
   
4. **User Interface:**
   - Create a user-friendly web interface using HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`style.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`).
   - Use AJAX or other techniques to communicate with the Flask server and display classification results on the web interface.
